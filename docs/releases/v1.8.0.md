# Networking Core Module Release 1.8.0

Welcome to the latest release of `Networking` module of [`Kubernetes Fury
Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team
SIGHUP.

This latest release is an attempt on upgrading the components in the module to
its latest stable release along with adding the tech preview of the latest
kubernetes release `v1.23.0`.

|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|

> Please refer the individual release notes to get a detailed info on the
> releases. `Calico` doesn't have any breaking changes in minor release `3.12.0`, but still would be worth having a look.

## Known Issues ⚠️

- This release involves recreation of certain resources like daemonset, deployments, etc. We recommend deleting it with `--cascade=orphan`, to avoid changes being made to the pods.
- We drop support of Kubernetes versions <= v1.19.x

## Breaking Changes 💔

- [#29](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/pull/29) Added Kubernetes labels to all the components of the module: Since `labels` are immutable fields in deployments, daemonsets, etc., this change requires a recreation of those resources.

## Features 💥

- [#28](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/pull/28) Added e2e-test support for k8s runtime `1.23`
- [#29](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/pull/29) Added Makefile, JSON builder and .bumpversion config to the module
- [#31](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/pull/31) Updated the RBAC policies for `calico` to work with version `v3.21.x`

## Bug Fixes 🐞

- [#30](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/pull/30) The upgrade of `calico` to > `v3.20.x` fixed issue [#27](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/issue/27), where calico ran out of IPs to assign.
- [#32](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/pull/32) The upgrade of `calico` to `v3.21.3` fixes issue where datastore watcher got stuck in clusters with >500 policies/pods/etc.

## Update Guide 🦮

### Warnings

Since the release ships changes to some immutable fields, if `deployments` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out.

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.11.x` to `v1.12.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project.

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/calico-node deployment.apps/calico-kube-controllers --cascade=orphan # This delete deployments, ds, etc. so the newly added labels can be applied
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f-
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/ip-masq-agent --cascade=orphan
kusomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f-
```
