Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution) maintained by team

> releases. `Calico` doesn't have any breaking changes in minor release `3.12.0`, but still would be worth having a look.

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- This release involves recreation of certain resources like daemonset, deployments, etc. We recommend deleting it with `--cascade=orphan`, to avoid changes being made to the pods.
- We drop support of Kubernetes versions <= v1.19.x

## Breaking Changes üíî

- [#29](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/29) Added Kubernetes labels to all the components of the module: Since `labels` are immutable fields in deployments, daemonsets, etc., this change requires a recreation of those resources.

## Features üí•

- [#28](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/28) Added e2e-test support for k8s runtime `1.23`
- [#29](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/29) Added Makefile, JSON builder and .bumpversion config to the module
- [#31](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/31) Updated the RBAC policies for `calico` to work with version `v3.21.x`

## Bug Fixes üêû

- [#30](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/30) The upgrade of `calico` to > `v3.20.x` fixed issue [#27](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/issue/27), where calico ran out of IPs to assign.
- [#32](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/32) The upgrade of `calico` to `v3.21.3` fixes issue where datastore watcher got stuck in clusters with >500 policies/pods/etc.

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Warnings

Since the release ships changes to some immutable fields, if `deployments` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out.

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.11.x` to `v1.12.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project.

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/calico-node deployment.apps/calico-kube-controllers --cascade=orphan # This delete deployments, ds, etc. so the newly added labels can be applied
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f-
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/ip-masq-agent --cascade=orphan
kusomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f-
```
