# Module Networking version 1.4.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.19 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. Also, the team, thanks @nutellinoit, has been working on providing examples about how to use
`GlobalNetworkPolicies` in a structured way to harden the networking security of the cluster.

## Changelog

- [Add some examples](../../examples/globalnetworkpolicies) to apply Calico `GlobalNetworkPolicy`.
  - Add some tests based on the examples listed above.
- Add e2e tests against Kubernetes 1.19 *(beta)*
- Update Calico 3.12 to 3.16.
- Move the Calico Grafana dashboard *(as a configmap)* from the monitoring module to this networking module.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.3.0` to `v1.4.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Important note

The upgrade takes some minutes (depends on the cluster size),
and you should expect some downtime during the upgrade process.
