## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Process

If you are using Cilium, read the steps [below](#cilium-upgrade) before proceeding.

1. Just deploy as usual:

```bash
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
# OR
kustomize build katalog/tigera/on-prem | kubectl apply -f -
# OR
kustomize build katalog/cilium | kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Cilium upgrade
Cilium suggested path expect a pre-flight check to be run before any upgrade.

1. Create the resources for the check
```bash
kubectl create -f katalog/cilium/tasks/preflight.yaml
```

2. Make sure that the number of READY pods is the same as the number of RUNNING Cilium pods.
```text
kubectl get daemonset -n kube-system | sed -n '1p;/cilium/p'
NAME                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
cilium                    2         2         2       2            2           <none>          1h20m
cilium-pre-flight-check   2         2         2       2            2           <none>          7m15s
```

3. Once the number of READY pods is equal, make sure the Cilium pre-flight deployment is also marked as READY 1/1.
If it shows READY 0/1, consult theÂ [CNP Validation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/operations/upgrade/#cnp-validation)Â section in the official docs and resolve issues with the deployment before continuing with the upgrade.
```text
kubectl get deployment -n kube-system cilium-pre-flight-check -w
NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cilium-pre-flight-check   1/1     1            0           12s
```

4. Once the number of READY for the preflightÂ DaemonSetÂ is the same as the number of cilium pods running and the preflightÂ DeploymentÂ is marked as READYÂ 1/1Â you can delete the cilium-preflight and proceed with the upgrade.
```bash
kubectl delete -f cilium-preflight.yaml
```


If you are upgrading from previous versions, please refer to the [`v1.14.0` release notes](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/releases/tag/v1.14.0).
