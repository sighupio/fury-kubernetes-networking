## Breaking Changes 💔

1. Manifest calico installation has been removed in favour of the Tigera Operator. There is a migration [guide](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-networking/blob/v2.0.0/katalog/tigera/README.md#migrating-from-calico-manifests-to-the-tigera-operator).

## Update Guide 🦮

```bash
kustomize build katalog/tigera/on-prem | kubectl apply -f -
# OR
kustomize build katalog/cilium | kubectl apply -f -
```
