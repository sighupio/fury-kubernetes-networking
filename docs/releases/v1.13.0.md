## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Process

From this version, you can start using Cilium as the CNI for a Kubernetes Fury on-premises cluster!

If you are upgrading from `v1.12.2`, there are no significant changes,  you need to:

1. delete the Grafana dashboard configmap:

```bash
kubectl delete configmap networking-grafana-dashboard -n default
```

2. deploy as usual:

```bash
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
# OR
kustomize build katalog/tigera/on-prem | kubectl apply -f -
```

If you are upgrading from previous versions, please refer to the [`v1.12.0` release notes](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/releases/tag/v1.12.0).
