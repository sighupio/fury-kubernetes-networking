## Bug fixes 🐞

- [[#87](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking/pull/87)] **Extended Cilium's mTLS selfg-signed CA certificated duration to 10 years** instead of having them expire before the peer certificates to avoid breaking communication.

## Update Guide 🦮

### Process

1. Just deploy as usual:

```bash
kustomize build katalog/tigera/on-prem | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
# OR
kustomize build katalog/cilium | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
```

2. (Cilium only) After applying the new version, you will need to manually trigger the renewal of the mTLS certificates for Cilium:

```bash
cmctl renew -n kube-system hubble-relay-client-certs
cmctl renew -n kube-system hubble-server-certs
```

Note: you will need cert-manager's CLI [`cmctl`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/cmctl/) installed.
