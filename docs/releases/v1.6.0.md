# Networking Core Module version v1.6.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.21 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release.

## Changelog

- Upgrade [calico](../../katalog/calico) CNI. From `3.17.1` to `3.19.1`.
- Kubernetes support:
  - Deprecate Kubernetes 1.17 support.
  - Kubernetes 1.20 is considered stable.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.5.1` to `v1.6.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Important note

The upgrade takes some minutes *(depends on the cluster size)*,
and you should expect some downtime during the upgrade process.
