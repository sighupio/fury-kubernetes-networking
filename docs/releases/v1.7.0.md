# Networking Core Module version 1.7.0

`module-networking` is part of the SIGHUP maintained [SIGHUP Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution). The module ships a networking stack to be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster based on Calico. Team SIGHUP by ReeVo makes it a priority to maintain these modules in compliance with CNCF and with all the latest features from upstream.

This release introduces the support for Kubernetes runtime `1.22` and drops support for `1.18`. Refer the [Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/sighupio/module-networking#compatibility) for more.
