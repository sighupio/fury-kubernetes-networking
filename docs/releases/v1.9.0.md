# Module Networking Release 1.9.0

Welcome to the latest release of `Networking` module of [`SIGHUP
Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution) maintained by team
SIGHUP by ReeVo.

This is a minor release that updates Calico to version 3.23.2. This update fixes a compatiblity issue with Kuberentes >= 1.21.

Kubernetes 1.21 introduced expiring Service Account Tokens by default and some Calico components where not handling the token renewal gracefully.

## Important changes

- Default MTU is not forced anymore and is set to `auto`, following upstream.
- POD CIDR is not set anymore, Calico has autodetection for clusters created with `kubeadm` (like SKD clusters).
- Calico 3.23 is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.20 or older.

## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Process

If you are upgrading from version `v1.8.0` or `v1.8.1` to `v1.9.0` you need to download this new version and then apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

There will be **downtime** on the components.

```bash
# Delete the deployments with the labels so they can be upgraded
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/calico-node deployment.apps/calico-kube-controllers
# Finally, apply the new version
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f-
# Delete the deployments with the labels so they can be upgraded
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/ip-masq-agent
# Finally, apply the new version
kusomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f-
```

If you are upgrading from  `v1.8.2`, you can simply apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

```bash
# To deploy Calico
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f-
# To deploy ipmasq
kusomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f-
```
