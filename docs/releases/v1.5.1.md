# Networking Core Module version v1.5.1

This patch contains only the change (and few examples) to move the container image from the `reg.sighup.io` registry
to `registry.sighup.io`.

## Changelog

- All the container images comes from SIGHUP registry to avoid rate limits.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.5.0` to `v1.5.1`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Important note

The upgrade takes some minutes *(depends on the cluster size)*,
and you should expect some downtime during the upgrade process.
