# Networking Core Module version v1.5.0

Welcome to a new update of the Fury Networking core module.
This time, we add Kubernetes 1.20 tech-preview support while deprecating the support to Kubernetes 1.16.
At the same time, Kubernetes 1.19 is officially supported by SIGHUP by ReeVo.
This release includes a new package `ip-masq` which allows sending network packages to other pods/nodes using
the underlay host node IP. It could be useful in some scenarios.
The release also includes a minor upgrade of the Calico deployment, from 3.16 to 3.17.

## Changelog

- Add [ip-masq package](../../katalog/ip-masq) to the module.
  - Add [an example](../../examples/configure-ip-masq) to fine configure it.
- Upgrade [calico](../../katalog/calico) CNI. From 3.16.1 to 3.17.1.
- Kubernetes support:
  - Deprecate Kubernetes 1.16 support.
  - Kubernetes 1.19 is considered stable.
  - Add tech-preview support to Kubernete 1.20.
- All the container images comes from SIGHUP registry to avoid rate limits.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.4.0` to `v1.5.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Important note

The upgrade takes some minutes *(depends on the cluster size)*,
and you should expect some downtime during the upgrade process.
