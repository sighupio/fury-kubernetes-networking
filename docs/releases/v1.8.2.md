## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Warnings

- Since the release rollbacks some changes to immutable fields, if `deployments`, `statefulset` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out. Check the Process below for more info.

### Process

If you are upgrading from version `v1.8.0` or `v1.8.1` to `v1.8.2` you need to download this new version and then apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

There will be **downtime** on the components.

```bash
# Delete the deployments with the labels so they can be upgraded
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/calico-node deployment.apps/calico-kube-controllers
# Finally, apply the new version
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f-
# Delete the deployments with the labels so they can be upgraded
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset.apps/ip-masq-agent
# Finally, apply the new version
kusomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f-
```

If you are upgrading from a version `< v1.6.0`, you can simply apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

```bash
# To deploy Calico
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f-
# To deploy ipmasq
kusomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f-
```
